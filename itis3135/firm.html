    <h2> About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        Personal Background: I am 20 years old. I was born in Queens, New York but have been in NC since I was 14.
        I've worked in the resturaunt industry my entire life and I've been at The Cowfish Sushi, Burger, and Bar for
        a little over 3.5 years. Once I graduate, I would love to rework  their app before I leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Academic Background: I went to school in Monroe, NC at Union County Early College.
        Now I am in my senior year at UNCC. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Background in the course: I have watched a couple of HTMl classes on YouTube which established a basic
        fundamental understanding of the language. As we continue to develop more information, I think I will be a fluent
        web developer by the end of the class. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Primary Computer Platform: Most of the time I work on MacOS because I have a laptop.
        I also use a desktop which runs Windows just in case I can use an application on the Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
        Courses Taking: Human Centered Design, HTML/Web Dev, and Introduction to Computer Architechture.
    </p>
    <p>Interesting Story and Fun Fact: At work, I am a Guest Service Specialist. So I have to deal with every upset guest and turn their experience around.
        A fun fact about me is that I love to code and would love to create mobile apps post grad.
