    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <h3> Good Website: <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank"> <div>Apple.com</div></a></h3>
    <p> This website is very good and follows the CRAP princples to T. CRAP stands for 
        contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. The contrast of this webiste uses color
        theory to use contrasting colors for different products and complementary colors to show
        their new products and make them look extra enticing. Every webpage is a constant reminder
        that you are on Apple's website with their logo being plastered in the top left corner of every page.
        The alignemnt is smooth too with a nav bar being placed up top to access any of the products with one link. 
        Finally, the proximity of everything is very close. For example, when you go the iPhone, it reccomends chargers,
        AirPods, and any other accessories that would go with the product. 
    </p>
    <h3> Bad Website: <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" target="_blank"> <div>1996 Space Jam</div></a></h3>
    <p> While the movie was amazing, unfortunately the website definitely is showing it's age. The first thing you will notice is the
        contrast of the colors along with the background. The background is a picture of space with stars in it.
        When you go to a link, it is just a picture with a paragraph underneath it. The text is written in red which
        causes some viewing problems due to the shade of red. The footer is written in yellow and the colors don't mesh
        well together. It does follow the repetition aspect by always having the Space Jam logo
        in the top left but it is surrounded by a white bar which looks TERRIBLE with the black background.
        The allignment is fine, all things considered. The website is very painful to the eye, everything is just centered,
        so in my opinion, isn't terrible. Finally, we have proximity, I'm not sure what the point of the webiste
        even is, and in order to get to a new area, you have to go back to the main page. There is no navigation bar
        to make traversing through the pages any easier.
